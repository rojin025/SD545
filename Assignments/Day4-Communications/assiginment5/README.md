# Instructions

1. Create a simple React component called Counter that displays a counter value initialized to 0. Include two buttons: one for incrementing the counter and another for decrementing it. Use useState to manage the counter state.

2. Create a temperature converter component that allows users to enter a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit when a button is clicked. Use useState to manage the temperature input and output.

3. Build a component that generates a random number between 1 and 100 when a button is clicked. Display the generated number using useState.
